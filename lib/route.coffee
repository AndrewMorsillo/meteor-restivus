  ###
    Convert all endpoints on the given route into our expected endpoint object if it is a bare function

    @param {Route} route The route the endpoints belong to
  ###
  _resolveEndpoints = (route) ->
    _.each route.endpoints, (endpoint, method, endpoints) ->
      if _.isFunction(endpoint)
        endpoints[method] = {action: endpoint}
    return


  ###
    Configure the authentication and role requirement on an endpoint

    Once it's globally configured in the API, authentication can be required on an entire route or individual
    endpoints. If required on an entire route, that serves as the default. If required in any individual endpoints, that
    will override the default.

    After the endpoint is configured, all authentication and role requirements of an endpoint can be accessed at
    <code>endpoint.authRequired</code> and <code>endpoint.roleRequired</code>, respectively.

    @param {Route} route The route the endpoints belong to
    @param {Endpoint} endpoint The endpoint to configure
  ###
  _configureEndpoints = (route) ->
    _.each route.endpoints, (endpoint) ->
        # Configure acceptable roles
      if not route.options?.roleRequired
        route.options.roleRequired = []
      if not endpoint.roleRequired
        endpoint.roleRequired = []
      endpoint.roleRequired = _.union endpoint.roleRequired, route.options.roleRequired
      # Make it easier to check if no roles are required
      if _.isEmpty endpoint.roleRequired
        endpoint.roleRequired = false

      # Configure auth requirement
      if not route.api.config.useAuth
        endpoint.authRequired = false
      else if endpoint.authRequired is undefined
        if route.options?.authRequired or endpoint.roleRequired
          endpoint.authRequired = true
        else
          endpoint.authRequired = false

    return


  ###
    Authenticate an endpoint if required, and return the result of calling it

    @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
    @returns The endpoint response or a 401 if authentication fails
  ###
  _callEndpoint = (route, endpoint) ->
    # Call the endpoint if authentication doesn't fail
    if _authAccepted.call this, route, endpoint
      if _roleAccepted.call this, route, endpoint

        body: {success: false, message: "You do not have permission to do this."}
    else
      statusCode: 401
      body: {success: false, message: "You must be logged in to do this."}


  ###
    Authenticate the given endpoint if required

    Once it's globally configured in the API, authentication can be required on an entire route or individual
    endpoints. If required on an entire endpoint, that serves as the default. If required in any individual endpoints, that
    will override the default.

    @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
    @returns False if authentication fails, and true otherwise
  ###
  _authAccepted = (route, endpoint) ->
    if endpoint.authRequired
      _authenticate.call this, route
    else true


  ###
    Verify the request is being made by an actively logged in user

    If verified, attach the authenticated user to the context.

    @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
    @returns {Boolean} True if the authentication was successful
  ###
  _authenticate = ->
    # Get the auth info from header
    userId = @request.headers['x-user-id']
    authToken = @request.headers['x-auth-token']

    # Get the user from the database
    if userId and authToken
      user = Meteor.users.findOne {'_id': userId, 'services.resume.loginTokens.token': authToken}

    # Attach the user and their ID to the context if the authentication was successful
    if user
      @user = user
      @userId = user._id
      true
    else false


  ###
    Authenticate the user role if required

    Must be called after _authAccepted().

    @context: IronRouter.Router.route() (after authentication)
    @returns True if the authenticated user belongs to <i>any</i> of the acceptable roles on the endpoint
  ###
  _roleAccepted = (route, endpoint) ->
    if endpoint.roleRequired
      if _.isEmpty _.intersection(endpoint.roleRequired, @user.roles)
        return false
    true


  ###
    Respond to an HTTP request

    @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
  ###
  _respond = (route, body, statusCode=200, headers) ->
    # Allow cross-domain requests to be made from the browser
    @response.setHeader 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'

    # Ensure that a content type is set (will be overridden if also included in given headers)
    # TODO: Consider enforcing a text/json-only content type (override any user-defined content-type)
    @response.setHeader 'Content-Type', 'text/json'

    # Prettify JSON if configured in API
    if route.api.config.prettyJson
      bodyAsJson = JSON.stringify body, undefined, 2
    else
      bodyAsJson = JSON.stringify body

    # Send response
    @response.writeHead statusCode, headers
    @response.write bodyAsJson
    @response.end()
