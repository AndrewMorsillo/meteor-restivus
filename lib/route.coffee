###
  Authenticate an endpoint if required, and return the result of calling it

  @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
  @returns The endpoint response or a 401 if authentication fails
###
callEndpoint = (route, endpoint) ->
  endpoint = resolveEndpoint endpoint

  # Call the endpoint if authentication doesn't fail

  Convert the given endpoint into our expected endpoint object if it is a bare function
###

###
  Authenticate the given endpoint if required

  Once it's globally configured in the API, authentication can be required on an entire route or individual
  endpoints. If required on an entire endpoint, that serves as the default. If required in any individual endpoints, that
  will override the default.

  @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
  @returns False if authentication fails, and true otherwise
###

      accept = authenticate.call this, route
  accept


###
  Verify the request is being made by an actively logged in user

  If verified, attach the authenticated user to the context.

  @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
  @returns {Boolean} True if the authentication was successful
###
authenticate = ->
  # Get the auth info from header
  userId = @request.headers['x-user-id']
  authToken = @request.headers['x-auth-token']

  # Get the user from the database
  if userId and authToken

  # Attach the user to the context if the authentication was successful
  if user
    @user = user
    true
  else false


###
  Respond to an HTTP request

  @context: IronRouter.Router.route()
###
respond = (route, body, statusCode=200, headers) ->
  # Allow cross-domain requests to be made from the browser
  @response.setHeader 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*'

  # Ensure that a content type is set (will be overridden if also included in given headers)
  # TODO: Consider enforcing a text/json-only content type (override any user-defined content-type)
  @response.setHeader 'Content-Type', 'text/json'

  # Prettify JSON if configured in API
  if route.api.config.prettyJson
    bodyAsJson = JSON.stringify body, undefined, 2
  else
    bodyAsJson = JSON.stringify body

  # Send response
  @response.writeHead statusCode, headers
  @response.write bodyAsJson
  @response.end()
